# Contributing to Web App Launchpad

Thanks for checking out this project. This repository is maintained with a portfolio-quality workflow: small changes, clear commits, readable documentation, and practical review notes.

## Contribution Principles

- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Update documentation when behavior, setup, or architecture changes.
- Avoid committing secrets, generated credentials, personal tokens, or private environment files.
- Include screenshots, terminal output, or test notes for UI/behavior changes.

## Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a focused branch
git checkout -b docs/improve-project-notes

# 2. Make the change
# edit files

# 3. Review locally
git status
git diff --check

# 4. Commit with a meaningful message
git add .
git commit -m "docs: improve project documentation"

# 5. Push and open a pull request
git push origin HEAD
```

## Commit Style
