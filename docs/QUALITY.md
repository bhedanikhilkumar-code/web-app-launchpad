# Quality Standard — Web App Launchpad

This document defines what makes the repository strong, review-ready, and portfolio-safe.

## Quality Goals

| Goal | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Clear first impression | README explains purpose, value, workflow, stack, and setup. |
| Reviewable structure | Architecture, case study, roadmap, and quality docs are easy to find. |
| Safe collaboration | Issue templates, PR template, security policy, support guide, and code of conduct exist. |
| Repeatable checks | Repository health workflow validates the professional documentation layer. |
| Portfolio readiness | A reviewer can understand the project without asking for missing context. |

## Stack Profile

| Area | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Detected stack | HTML |
| Primary language | HTML |
| Topics | css, github-pages, html, javascript, starter, webapp |

## Recommended Checks

| Check | Command / Location |
| --- | --- |
| Repository health | `GitHub Actions → Repository Health workflow` |

## Repository Health Gate

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/repository-health.yml` checks that the project has:

- README with a documentation hub.
- Architecture, case study, roadmap, quality, and review docs.
- Contribution, security, support, and conduct files.
- Issue and pull request templates.
- Clear repository ownership.

## Definition of Strong

A strong repository should be able to answer these questions quickly:

1. What problem does it solve?
2. Who is it for?
3. What is the main workflow?
4. How is the code/project organized?
5. How can someone run, review, or extend it?
6. What is planned next?
7. How are contributions and security handled?

## Continuous Improvement

After every meaningful update:

- Update README if the user-facing behavior changes.
- Update architecture docs if structure changes.
- Update roadmap when items are completed or reprioritized.
- Add screenshots or demos when the UI/workflow becomes visually important.
- Keep commits small and meaningful.
