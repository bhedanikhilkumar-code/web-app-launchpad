## Executive Overview

Starter repository for building modern web applications.

This README is written as a **portfolio-grade project document**: it explains the product idea, technical approach, architecture, workflows, setup process, engineering standards, and future roadmap so a reviewer can understand both the codebase and the thinking behind it.

## Product Positioning

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **Who is it for?** | Users, reviewers, recruiters, and developers who want to understand the project quickly. |
| **What problem does it solve?** | It turns a practical idea into a structured software project with clear workflows and maintainable implementation direction. |
| **Why it matters?** | The project demonstrates product thinking, stack selection, feature planning, and clean documentation discipline. |
| **Current focus** | Professional polish, understandable architecture, and portfolio-ready presentation. |

## Repository Snapshot

| Area | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Visibility | Public portfolio repository |
| Primary stack | `HTML`, `CSS` |
| Repository topics | `css`, `github-pages`, `html`, `javascript`, `starter`, `webapp` |
| Useful commands | Documented in setup section |
| Key dependencies | No dependency manifest detected |

## Topics

`css` · `github-pages` · `html` · `javascript` · `starter` · `webapp`

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Clear purpose** | Documents the problem, users, and value proposition for quick understanding. |
| **Maintainable structure** | Separates core logic, UI, services, and assets where the stack supports it. |
| **Professional docs** | Includes architecture, setup, quality checks, roadmap, and contribution guidance. |
| **Portfolio-ready** | Presented as a finished engineering artifact rather than a rough experiment. |

    D --> E[Evaluate quality and roadmap]

```

### Feature Depth Matrix

| Layer | What reviewers should look for | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Clear user problem, target audience, and workflow | Shows product thinking beyond tutorial-level code |
| Interface | Screens, pages, commands, or hardware interaction points | Demonstrates how users actually experience the project |
| Logic | Validation, state transitions, service methods, processing flow | Proves the project can handle real use cases |
| Data | Local storage, database, files, APIs, or device input/output | Explains how information moves through the system |
| Quality | Tests, linting, setup clarity, and roadmap | Makes the project easier to trust, extend, and review |

### Conceptual Data / State Model

| Entity / State | Purpose | Example fields or responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User input | Starts the main workflow | Form values, commands, uploaded files, device readings |
| Domain model | Represents the project-specific object | Transaction, note, shipment, event, avatar, prediction, song, or task |
| Service layer | Applies rules and coordinates actions | Validation, scoring, formatting, persistence, API calls |
| Storage/output | Keeps or presents the result | Database row, local cache, generated file, chart, dashboard, or device action |
| Feedback loop | Helps improve the next interaction | Status message, analytics, error handling, recommendations, roadmap item |

### Professional Differentiators

- **Documentation-first presentation:** A reviewer can understand the project without guessing the intent.
- **Diagram-backed explanation:** Architecture and workflow diagrams make the system easier to evaluate quickly.
- **Real-world framing:** The README describes users, outcomes, and operational flow rather than only listing files.
- **Extension-ready roadmap:** Future improvements are scoped so the project can keep growing cleanly.
- **Portfolio alignment:** The project is positioned as part of a consistent, professional GitHub portfolio.

    A->>L: Process request
    L->>D: Save/update state
    D-->>L: State/result
    L-->>A: Return useful result
    A-->>U: Updated experience
```

## Engineering Notes

- **Separation of concerns:** UI, business logic, data/services, and platform concerns are documented as separate layers.
- **Scalability mindset:** The project structure is ready for new screens, services, tests, and deployment improvements.
- **Portfolio quality:** README content is designed to communicate value before someone even opens the code.
- **Maintainability:** Naming, setup steps, and roadmap items make future work easier to plan and review.
- **User-first framing:** Features are described by the value they provide, not just the technology used.

## Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>

# Follow the stack-specific setup notes in the source files.
```

## Suggested Quality Checks

Before shipping or presenting this project, run the checks that match the stack:

| Check | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Format/lint | Keep code style consistent and reviewer-friendly. |
| Static analysis | Catch type, syntax, and framework-level issues early. |
| Unit/widget tests | Validate important logic and user-facing workflows. |
| Manual smoke test | Confirm the main flow works from start to finish. |
| README review | Ensure documentation matches the actual repository state. |

## Roadmap
